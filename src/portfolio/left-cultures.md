A new Shopify theme designed and developed for Left Cultures magazine. The site was commissioned to be a closer representation of the print magazine's bold and distinctive look. Coded for Shopify, it has solved some long running issues the Left Cultures team experienced on their previous platform. These issues included: making the experience easier for international customers, including accurate and fair shipping costs, including a filterable authors section that allowed people to discover authors who write about specific themes, adding a lexicon that allowed readers to find topics covered in specific issues of the magazine and the ability for site uses to discover more about the contributors to the magazine.
